Pollin' Season Version 1.1

Make, take, and view custom polls!

This project is running at the following URL: https://pollin-season.herokuapp.com/, and largely follows the project guidelines suggested by FreeCodeCamp, described here (http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/basejump-build-a-voting-app).

Version 1.1 implemented secure session cookies and a sharing feature. I am not 100% finished with this project. Here's what I hope to tinker on in the future:


1. Code organization that more closely follows best practices

2. 100% exhaustive error handling

3. Pagination for large lists of polls

4. Improved look/feel

5. Use React.JS for views

6. Further reduce code redundancy


I disregarded certain parts of the FreeCodeCamp project requirements. Namely, I chose to restrict poll access to authenticated users. Any authenticated user can vote on any poll, but only the poll's creator can edit or remove a given poll.
