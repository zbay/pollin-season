Pollin' Season Version 1.1

Make, take, and view custom polls!

This project is running at the following URL: https://pollin-season.herokuapp.com/, and largely follows the project guidelines suggested by FreeCodeCamp, described here (http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/basejump-build-a-voting-app).

I am not 100% finished with this project. Here's what I hope to tinker on in the future:

~~1. Secure session cookies~~

2. Code organization that more closely best practices

3. 100% exhaustive error handling

4. Pagination for large lists of polls

5. Improved look/feel

6. Use React.JS for views

7. Further reduce code redundancy

~~8. Enable poll watchlists and a sharing feature~~

I disregarded certain parts of the FreeCodeCamp project requirements. Namely, I chose to restrict poll access to authenticated users. Any authenticated user can vote on any poll, but only the poll's creator can edit or remove a given poll.
